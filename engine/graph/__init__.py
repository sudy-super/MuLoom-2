"""
Graph assembly helpers for the MuLoom engine.

Each submodule provides helper classes that encapsulate a small portion of the
GStreamer graph.  They are currently defined as light-weight placeholders so
the rest of the code base can import stable symbols while the actual Gst
integration is being implemented.
